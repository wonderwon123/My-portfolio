            <h1>About Photography</h1>
            <p class="one">Photography is the art, science, and practice of capturing and preserving pictures by
                recording light, either electronically with an image sensor or chemically with a light-sensitive
                substance like photographic film. It has a wide range of applications in research, industry, and
                business, as well as more direct applications in art, film and video production, leisure activities,
                hobbies and mass communication. And it is usually done by camera which records the image. The person who
                clicks picture is a photographer.

                shot.Photography has been used as a tool for science and exploration, documenting people, places, and
                events, telling tales and collecting histories, and as a form of communication and critique in our
                increasingly visual culture throughout history and into the current day.There are various types of
                photography inwhich each of them have theri own traits and based on them we can find which is easy and

            <h1>History of Photography</h1>
            <p class="one">
                The action of light, or similar radiation, on a light-sensitive substance is used to record the picture
                of an object in photography's history. The term was coined in the 1830s and is derived from the Greek
                words photographs (“light”) and graphein (“to draw”).Rather than being only fiction, photography makes
                historical events appear more genuine. Photographs, like any other source or relic, will be debated. The
                use of photography in historical documentation has become indispensable. It gives us a look into parts
                of society that haven't been investigated or examined before.At originally, photography was either
                employed to assist painters in their work or followed the same ideas as painters. Portraits of a single
                individual or a family were frequently the earliest widely known portraits.George Eastman, who began
                making paper film in 1885 before moving to celluloid in 1889, was a pioneer in the use of photographic
                film. In 1888, his first camera, named the "Kodak," was made available for purchase.
